##Contributions Welcome!

This project is for the whole Hacker School community. Right now, we don't have a great place to chat across the batches: email is too high-pressure, Humbug is too noisy. But here, alums from every batch can come to talk about interesting articles about programming. 

Please feel free to contribute features if you'd like practice working on web applications. Here are some ideas for potential projects. Reach out to Sasha if you have any other project ideas or questions. 

### High priority:
- a "submit" function so people can add outside articles for discussion, like on Hacker News. Then, the new blog posts by Hacker Schoolers will be considered "auto-submitted" (@kenyavs is working on this)
- Email subscription: allow people to sign up to get emailed when there are new posts
- allow users to add their blog feed URL from inside the app

### Would also be awesome:
- a bookmarklet so people can submit articles right from their browser
- voting on posts (this might be used someday to determine which articles should publicly represent Hacker School)
- a security audit of the app
- viewing profiles of other users locally (right now we just link to their HS page)
- allow users to edit their profiles
- allow users to log out
- host avatars instead of hotlinking them
- [there are some nice bugs to tackle](https://github.com/sursh/blaggregator/issues?page=1&state=open), mostly around encoding

### Done by past contributors: 
- a bot to post new blog posts to Humbug (thanks, @einashaddad and @kenyavs)
- comments on posts (@sursh)
- scraper script to check blogs for updates (thanks, @brannerchinese)
- an atom feed (thanks, @santialbo)
- pagination of the main page (so users can look back through the archives) (thanks, @santialbo)
- dropdown navigation menu (thanks, @porterjamesj)
