This project is intended to be useful to the Hacker School community. Please feel free to contribute features if you'd like practice working on web applications. Here are some ideas for potential projects: 

- a bot to post new blog posts to Humbug
- a "submit" function so people can add outside articles, like on Hacker News
- a bookmarklet so people can submit articles right from their browser
- voting on posts (this might be used someday to determine which articles should publicly represent Hacker School)
- comments on posts
- prettier CSS
- account management: log out, edit profile
- viewing profiles of other users
- a security audit of the app
