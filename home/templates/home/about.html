            <p class="question">What is this?</p>

            <p class="answer">It's a blog aggregator and technical discussion tool for the entire Hacker School community. </p>

            <p class="answer">In the winter session in 2013, Sasha noticed that her peers were all blogging about their work at Hacker School on their individual blogs. It was really cool to see what they were working on and thinking about. </p>

            <p class="answer">Some folks would post about their new posts in Zulip, some on Twitter, and some wouldn't spread the word at all. There was all this great work going on, but hard to find it. </p>

            <p class="answer">Blaggregator puts all this awesome content in one place. This has the nice side effect of providing a friendly audience for those who may have just launched their blog. </p>

            <p class="answer">And as more features like comments and article submission are added, it may serve as what Hacker News should have beenâ€”a place for technical folks to discuss technical news and work. </p>

            <p class="question">Who's behind it?</p>

            <p class="answer">Sasha (W '13) is the primary maintainer. [Ten other Hacker Schooler]() (and counting!) have contributed. [You are encouraged to contribute as well](). </p>

            <p class="question">Why do I have to log in?</p>
            
            <p class="answer">Hacker School staff have requested the list of people attending Hacker School be kept private. This may change in the future. If that ever changes (for instance, to surface the best posts that are coming out of Hacker School to show off what we're working on) you will be given lots and lots of warning to decide how you want to participate. </p>


            <p class="question">How does it work?</p>

            <p class="answer">Once an hour, it checks all registered blogs for new posts ("new" is defined as having a new URL, so you can tweak the title and change the timestamp to your heart's content). New posts are displayed on the [main page]() and a message is sent to Zulip. The rest of the app provides the web interface. </p>

            <p class="question">What's the stack?</p>

            <p class="answer">It's a Django app and therefore written in Python. Celery with a Redis backend handles all the asynchronous work. It's deployed on Heroku using their version of PostGreSQL. Check out the code  [here]().</p>

            <p class="question">I found a bug</p>

            <p class="answer">Great/sorry! Please [open an issue]() or contribute a patch.</p>

            <p class="question">Can I contribute?</p>

            <p class="answer">Yes, that would be great! There's a list of [suggested contributions] and [open issues] if you're looking for an idea. Before starting a major contribution, it's wise to get in touch with Sasha to make sure it will fit with the rest of the roadmap. </p>

            <p class="question">Can I lurk?</p>
            
            <p class="answer">Sure, just make an account and don't add your blog. But you shouldn't lurk. You should blog.</p>

            <p class="question">Why should I blog?</p>
            
            <ul class="answer">
                <li>It provides a record of your thinking and work for your future self.</li>
                <li>It gives prospective employers insight into the way you think. </li>
                <li>If you do a project that doesn't go as planned, you can still 'finish' the project and explain what you learned, even if you don't want to put the code on Github.</li>
                <li>It helps more people hear about and respect Hacker School, which in turn means more people will want to work with you.</li>
                <li>Writing helps you practice communicating, which is critical if you plan on working on teams of more than 1 person.</li>
                <li>It helps the developer community at large. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="question">But blogging takes too long!</p>

            <p class="answer">Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Your posts don't have to be long, groundbreaking, perfect, proofread, or full of citations. Short, imperfect, and <em>published</em> always beats unpublished. It's important, make time for it. </p>

            <p class="question">But I haven't found the perfect blogging tool</p>

            <p class="answer">Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Just get something up and resist the urge to fiddle with it. Use tumblr if you have to. Just start writing. </p>
