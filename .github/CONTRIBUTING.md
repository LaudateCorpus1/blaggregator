# Contributing to Blaggregator!

Blaggregator is a blog aggregator for the Recurse Center, built and maintained
by the community.  Thank you for considering contributing to it, and taking the
time to read this document! :heart: :heart: :heart:

If you enjoy the tool or are interested in practicing web programming on a
"real app" that's used at least by a few hundred people, quite regularly, this
is a great way to get some experience.  Please feel free to contribute features
and fixes.  If you have any questions or project ideas, get in touch with
Puneeth(@punchagan) or Sasha(@sursh).

## Code of conduct

RC's social rules apply, while you are contributing to this Blaggregator!

## Commit-messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally
- When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit
  description

## Pull-requests

- Adding tests for the code you submit is highly encouraged!
- If you are making a UI change, try and include a screenshot.
- Before starting work on a big feature/contribution, you are encouraged to let
  us know in a related issue.
- :+1: for referring to issue numbers in your pull-requests

## Some general ideas/areas to help in

- More stuff should happen "async".  Currently, most things happen
  synchronously, not giving the best possible user experience

- Anything that makes it easier for alum (who usually find it hard to keep up
  with Zulip) to follow Blaggregator posts

- Make it easier to search for old posts - by author, content, topic, etc.

- Testing/security - Security audit of the app or adding more tests to the app
  would go a long way
